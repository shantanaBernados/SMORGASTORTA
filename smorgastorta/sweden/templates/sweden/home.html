	<h3>Self-Rated Health</h3>
	<p>Health refers to the physical, mental, and social condition of the body. It indicates the general state of well-being of a person or of a group of people and it has an important role in the lives of every man. Knowledge about one’s health is essential to the way a person acts and adapts to cope with illnesses and diseases which can appear in his/her daily life. As such, the need to learn about how to prevent and cure ailments and disorders has become a vital research topic.
	<p>Health research has always been centered on improving the current state and condition of society. Various studies concerning health have been conducted to gain knowledge about the general state of health of the public. The most common form of health research would be the clinical trial where volunteer patients test the efficiency of new medical interventions (Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research, pg. 19). A large portion of health research requires the analysis of existing data to identify disease patterns and risk factors, and assess proper medication and health care services. It provides information about “…disease trends and risk factors, outcomes of treatment or public health interventions, functional abilities, patterns of care, and health care costs and utilization. They have led to significant discoveries, the development of new therapies, and a remarkable improvement in health care and public health. Thus, they provide a sense of hope for people with chronic, life-threatening, or fatal conditions” (Beyond the HIPAA Privacy Rule: Enhancing Privacy, Improving Health Through Research). </p>
	<p>Health research has become a high-valued and vital part of society. It has to be continuously supported and maintained so as to keep society fit for the rapid changes that are occurring in the environment. One important aspect of health research that can greatly affect health-related developments and services is being able to predict possible future health trends and behaviors. “The prediction of health outcomes from available data is an important problem in health research and health management” (Song, Mitnitski, Cox, & Rockwood, 2004). The topic of health prediction is becoming popular in the field of healthcare. To further improve health care and services and to come up with countermeasures for emergencies, it is important to know changes and trends in health which can cause certain health problems. </p>
	<p>Studies have been made to come up with a model which can accurately predict one’s future health. Many of these studies are catered to the idea that the human psychology greatly affects health behavior. A certain model called the Health Belief Model believes that a person acts based on his/her attitude and beliefs (“Health Belief Model,” n.d.). It relies on the idea that a person only takes care of himself when he/she believes that he/she is in danger. It also believes that a person’s actions today may have severe consequences on his/her health tomorrow.</p>
	<p>The Health Belief Model is highly used in the field of healthcare. In accordance to one’s beliefs, he/she acts in a way which he/she finds beneficial. Hence, if the person finds exercising beneficial, then he/she will exercise out of his/her own will. If a person finds eating unhealthy food beneficial, then he/she will do so no matter what. Thus, the human state of mind can be an important indicator and predictor for future health. As such, there is one health variable which is highly influenced by the human psychology. This variable relies on an individual’s subjective view on his/her well-being. It can be a measure for future state of health. It is called the Self-rated Health.</p>

	<h3>Sleep Problem</h3>
	<p>Sleep problem, such as difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, has been a prevalent issue for many people in this sleep-deprived society. Michael Breus (2010), a Clinical Psychologist and a Diplomat of the American Board of Sleep Medicine, on his attempt to answer the question “Why are sleep problems becoming more common?” wrote that a probable reason for the increasing number of people having sleep problems would be because of the rise of an industrial society. Having an industrial society basically means, people are trying to work their butts off just to be able to cope up with the demands of a society with a high capacity for division of labor (Langlois, 2001). In other words, it refers to a society filled mostly of people who are working. The constant exposure to the work environment has been proven to cause work-related stress both among women and men. This work-related stress together with mental strain were the most common cause of stress-related disorders which has been the topic of a large body of research in Sweden because of its  negative economic impact. </p>
	<p>In Sweden, there has been an increase in not only stress-related disorders but also in complaints of fatigue and poor sleep (Dahlgren, 2006). Both stress and disturbed sleep was considered to be a very important research topic among the field of psychology and medicine today. Recent studies shows that disturbed sleep have a clear association with stress. A study conducted by Akerstedt (2006), was able to successfully present a clear relationship between physiological stress and impaired sleep (which will be further discussed in chapter two of this paper). Because of the clear relationship between the two, it is plausible that their interaction towards each other would be bidirectional such that an increased arousal due to sleep will cause problems of falling asleep, sleep disturbances and early awakenings and on the other hand, poor sleep itself can cause an elevation in physiological arousal (Buckley & Schatzber as cited in Dahlgren, 2006). Thus, a person’s sleep quality has often been associated as a measure of one’s stress. </p>
	<p>Aside from stress-disorders, sleep problems, commonly referred to as sleep disorders, also causes a lot of major public health issues in many industrialized countries and are expected to become increasingly common in decades. Such disorders have a negative economic impact, disrupt work and home life and might even increase suicide risk (Hillman et al., 2006). For the research fields related to sleep studies, detecting if a person has a possible sleep problem or not is an important research topic. Usually this is done by performing scoring vigilance (measuring sleep using polysomnography, or using the most common way of conducting structured interviews) which is a time-consuming work to a well-experience expert. A variety of sleep questionnaires designed to measure the quality of sleep have been developed over the past decades. But analysis of the results of these questionnaires still required human intervention. To solve this problem, this study aims to use results of sleep questionnaires together with other measures of stress that are proven to be related to sleep and conduct machine learning to these values to detect a possible instance of a sleep problem on an individual. By collecting the person’s medical stress data and focusing on the data which covers indices about sleep, machine-learning-based classification models were constructed to recognize the patterns of behavior during sleep that could be used in detecting a sleep problem. The researcher aimed to find a suitable machine learning approach that could be used to make sleep problem detection fast and reliable and can help a person prevent his or her sleep problem from worsening while it is still in its early stage.</p>

	<h3>Sickness Absence Risk</h3>
	<p>Managing long-term sickness absence has always been a critical task for business owners and managers on any institution. If not managed well, sickness absences among the staff workers may put the business in a particularly problematic situation. Therefore, there is a need to foresee any sickness absences among the employees to ensure that the business doesn’t suffer any major deficits, and more importantly, the company owners and managers can safeguard their employees’ wellbeing.</p>
	<p>There have been many studies that were aimed to predict a worker’s probability of having sickness absence. One of these studies is conducted by Lennart Hallsten. According to Hallsten et. al., sickness absence is a potential byproduct of burnout (Hallsten, Josephson, Torgén, & Arbetslivsinstitutet, 2005a). As he had noted in his study, burnout is referred to as the condition indicated by long-term exhaustion and a noticeable disinterest from work. Different studies have supported Hallsten’s statement that burnout is a clear predictor of sickness absence. A study conducted by Ahola et. al. showed that severe burnout is heavily associated with the risk of sickness absence among both men and women (Ahola et al., 2008). As stated by Ahola, the odds ratio of sickness absence and severe burnout was 6.9 for men and 2.1 for women. With this study, we can undoubtedly see the effects of burnout with sickness absence.</p>
	<p>With the prevalent studies that relate burnout to sickness absence, burnout instruments were used to predict the risk of sickness absence of an individual. However, these instruments were still not practical in assessing the risk of sickness absence, since there are other predictors that could contribute to the said risk. Thus, until this day, researchers are still studying new methods and instruments to better assess the sickness absence probability of an individual.<p>
	<p>The goal of this research, then, is to create a new instrument for assessing sickness absence. In this thesis, different machine learning techniques were used to predict if an employee is likely to have an over-risk of sickness absence during the following year. With machine learning, it is possible to take in several predictors of sickness absence and train the machine to predict whether or not a person has an over-risk of sickness absence. Since there are still no efficient way of calculating the probability of sickness leave, the goal of this thesis is to create a new model that provides a mathematical approach in the assessment of a person’s risk of sickness leave.</p>
	<p>The approach of assessing sickness absence using machine learning is something that is still unpopular. As of today, only few studies have actually used machine learning models to solve this particular research problem. One such study is a work done by Ina Lundström. In her study, she created decision trees to classify if a person has an over-risk of long-term sickness absence (Lundström, 2013). In addition, her results showed that the decision trees she used had a really high accuracy. However, upon closer inspection, the decision trees were not able to classify the people with high risk of sickness absence. This means that her decision tree is only good at classifying an individual with low risk of sickness absence, but cannot generalize the people with high risk of sickness absence.</p>
	<p>Expectantly, this thesis will produce an even better model with a higher performance. In this study, machine learning techniques like logistic regression models, support vector machines, and Naïve-Bayes algorithm will be utilized. These algorithms will be applied to the research problem. In this manner, the performance of each algorithms will be measured to get a conclusion on which among these algorithms are better suited in evaluating the sickness absence risk of the working class.</p>
